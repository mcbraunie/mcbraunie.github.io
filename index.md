I am a Sophomore studying Software Engineering and working on several projects to build my skillset. Past, present, and current/future projects are being showcased here under my 'Projects' section, so please feel free to take a look as I keep updating these.

Many of my previous projects in human/computer interactions have involved finding ways to improve the quality of the work environment by identifying time-intensive tasks and streamlining repetetive tasks and/or creating automated processes to handle such tasks. I believe this can be accomplished in many areas (be it a simple spreadsheet, web-driven technologies, or building a physical end-product in my home garage).

I enjoy the arena of improving the lives of those, like myself, living with disabilities. I believe that technology can play an invaluable role in improving our quality of life and I look forward to contributing more in this field as I gain more knowledge in my journey.
